It's a beaut!  And the stuff that came off it, `istrewth!`i`0\"  You contemplate the years of loving use, years of happy experimentation, the flavours of ten thousand carefully-prepared meals - the experience that took Maiko from an amateur cook to a professional chef.  Irreplacable memories.  \"`6Anyway, it's all gone now, an' it's good as new.`0\"`n`nYou force yourself to smile as convincingly as you can, and look from the dead pan up to Sheila.  \"`#It looks great.

It didn't really work, and it left some viewers blinking owlishly at their televisions.  Also, if you're going to do a big dramatic buildup like that, you've got to get some violence going.  Or try to crowbar in a bit of nookie.  Personally I don't think Maiko and Akira will come to anything - they might flirt a bit just 'cause tension works in funny ways sometimes, but I don't think either of them will make a move.  Perhaps next time we'll get a romantic subplot going.  Viewers like that sort of thing.`n`nI dunno what to make of Akira, myself.  I don't know whether he's hot for teacher, or genuinely thoughtful, or just a wee bit simple.
